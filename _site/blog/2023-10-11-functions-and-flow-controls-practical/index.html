                        <p>This session was a continuation of our Functions and flow control work, but with some additional practical exercises.</p>
<p>You can see all the code I wrote for this session over on my codepen: <a href="https://codepen.io/SophieRegular/pen/vYvazgR">codepen.io/SophieRegular/pen/vYvazgR&gt;</a></p>
<p><strong>Task 1 - Writing a function to output a percentage</strong></p>
<p>My personal nemesis (percentages!) but I managed to do it. I declared the number and percentage arguments in the function, then asked it to return them multiplied and divided by 100. I then created a console log asking it to output the percentage function I'd created with numbers of my choosing to test that it worked (pleased to report that it did).</p>
<p><strong>Task 2 - Creating a soft drinks selector with a switch loop</strong></p>
<p>This task asked us to create a function that used a switch loop to output a drinks selection based on a drink size and a drink label. The switch worked as follows:</p>
<p>You have three options: Lemonade ('label: lemon'), Orangeade ('label: Orange'), &amp; Cola (default)</p>
<p>If you don't pick lemon, the switch breaks and moves to orange. If you don't pick orange, the switch breaks goes to default (which is cola)</p>
<p>The returned output uses a template literal that states: <em>'you have ordered a $ {#size#} ${#drinklabel#}.'</em> - which is then called with a console log function that selects the size and drinks label you've requested.</p>
<p><strong>Task 3 - Create a calculator!</strong></p>
<p>Exactly as it states! We had to write a function that uses a switch loop to select an arithmetic operator and perform a calculation.</p>
<p>My first attempt at this didn't work - the structure I'd picked was correct, but the syntax and how I'd written it out was wrong. My second attempt <em>did</em> work, after I'd corrected this and written it out properly.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Another session with some challenging tasks, but nothing too difficult to understand. I really enjoyed using the switch loops for these. It's really fun to use these functions to create systems that you can understand would be used in a practical day-to-day scenario (takes me back to building traffic lights and ferris wheels with flowcharts in flowol!)</p>
