                        <p><strong>Hello - welcome to my first Eleventy blog post!</strong></p>
<p>I've built this as part of my 'working with static sites' assignment with the Coders' Guild.</p>
<p>This week we learned about Static Sites &amp; Static Site Generators. We learned how they work in comparison with other dynamic website setups - which usually work with a backend server, and handle more complex features &amp; data. The SSG platform we're using to build our blogs is Eleventy - which is a generating platform part of a model that's known as the JAMStack, which stands for Javascript, API &amp; Markup.</p>
<p>Though I was familiar with Static sites (being a child of the 90's and growing up with Web 1.0), I'd never used a Static Site Generator before and I'd definitely never used a JAMStack model to build a website. In our lesson we deployed a base Eleventy blog template via Netlify &amp; Github, which we could then use to customise and set up for our own personal use.</p>

<p>I <em>really</em> struggled with the template when I first encountered it. I'd never used nunjucks before and I was completely unfamiliar with using templating languages to build web pages, having previously only ever worked with html and css stylesheets. I didn't understand how the different folders responded to each other, how the _site folder worked and why I couldn't put content in it - because that's where the indexes were?!</p>
<p>I also found all of the additional plugins and features that came bundled with the template really overwhelming and confusing. Even after googling and reading documentation on the website, I didn't understand how the different scripts interacted with each other - which then also made it difficult to edit, because I wasn't sure what features were critical for all of the plug-ins to work.</p>
<p>I submitted the original template (with a broken link to a logo, lol) for the week's assignment - but I knew if I was going to create anything even remotely functional, I was going to have to go back to basics and learn how the platform worked from the ground up.</p>

<p>I used a mix of these videos and tutorials online to go back and set my own blog up from scratch. Though it was a more time consuming process - I'm <em>really</em> thankful that I took the time out to do it. I learned so much through doing it - including using a lot of processes and languages I'd never used before like node.js, json, javascript configuration as well as nunjucks itself.</p>
<p>The bit i'm most proud of is that the blog itself is a functional template! It's not entirely hard-code free (we're using Bootstrap as our styling framework, so all of the styling is 'inline' so to speak) - but the headers and footers are complete independant from each page, set up as nunjucks templates in the _includes folder. The templates all talk to each other using the {#%- includes -%#} tags which meant that I didn't have to copy and paste elements over and over again - I could just include each template at a time, as and when I needed it.</p>
<p>Using front matter and templates like this has been a total gamechanger for me. Being able to code a blog platform from scratch that I don't have to manually update every time I make style changes to something is really cool. In the future, I would like to learn more CSS &amp; Sass to be able to more the styling more global and customisable.</p>
