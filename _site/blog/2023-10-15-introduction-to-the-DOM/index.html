                        <p>This session was an introduction to the Document Object Model, and looking at ways that javaScript can be used to modify it.</p>
<p>You can find links to all of the tasks I completed for this session over on my codepen: <a href="https://codepen.io/SophieRegular">codepen.io/SophieRegular&gt;</a></p>
<p>--</p>
<p>The DOM - which is shorthand for the 'Document Object Model', is a method of structuring webpages. In our lesson, we learned how the DOM works - how webpages are structured like trees, with each element on the page being nested within each other, like branches.</p>

<p>We learned that the content of a website gets loaded into an JavaScript object, called 'document'. This object can then be treated much like other objects in JavaScript. You can use different selectors with dot notations to isolate and select different nodes within a webpage's structure and edit them.</p>
<p>You can also create what's known as an 'Event' object. Events form the basis of most interactive elements on webpages. Without them, a lot of the things we use on websites - dynamic menus, carousels, web links and video playback would be impossible.</p>
<p>Events are created whenever someone interacts with an element on a webpage - so for example, if someone 'clicked' on a link, the href within that link element would be triggered, and it would take you to another page. Event listeners look out for user interactions, and are used to make something happen once the interaction meets a certain criteria - like a click, a mouseover, a keyup, and more.</p>
<p>A lot of HTML elements have default event behaviours pre-built into them. JavaScript can be used to override these behaviours - either to stop them from happening or to modify what they do.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>After the lesson part of the session, we then went through a series of challenges on codepen to modify the page behaviour based on a series of prompts given to us. This was really helpful, because it allowed me to see how the different script commands could be used on an actual webpage.</p>
<p>It's also great to know for future coding, because I can now use this DOM knowledge to look at different ways I can modify and add activity to my webpages. Additionally, I've long had an interest in small scale game design - and I can totally see how these DOM commands could be utilised to create some really simple browser games. It will be fun to put it to practice again at a later date!</p>
