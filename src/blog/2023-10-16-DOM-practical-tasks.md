In this session, we did a group practical using the DOM skills we learned in the previous lesson.

First, we had to create a html page with links to a variety of 16 animal photos - 4 photos of 4 different animals. We also had to create a form with 5 radio buttons - one for each species of animal, and one for 'show all'. We also had to create a field for a search bar and button. 

Then, we went through step by step as a group to build a programme that would allow users to filter and search for the animals via their 'animalType' and 'alt' attributes. This was the outcome:

I found this session quite overwhelming when we first approached it - just because it's the largest amount of javaScript i've worked with in one go! However, when we broke each section down task by task, it was a lot more manageable and easy to understand. It was also very satisfying getting all of the sections to work bit by bit as we went through it!
