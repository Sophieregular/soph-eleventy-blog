Programming at last! This section of the 'Web Design' bootcamp was the one I was most looking forward to. I actually have very little hands-on programming experience - but when I was a kid, we did a lot of programming & programming-adjacent learning (using things like Flowol, games that taught you Inputs & Outputs, that weird turtle robot everyone just used to have in primary school) and I always really enjoyed it.

Despite my excitement - I also was approaching this section of the course with a bit of apprehension. Because I'd not done a ton of programming, I was nervous that I was going to find it too challenging. One of my biggest personal barriers to learning to code (even though I've always found it interesting) is that I've not always felt 'smart' enough to do it. Having ADHD means I get a bit panicked and flustered if I have to process lots of info on the spot - so things like maths, especially mental maths can be a bit of a challenge. 

However, just like maths, if I take my time to really understand it, I'm usually pretty good at figuring it out. I didn't need to worry anyway for this session because it was just really basic introductory stuff!

<h3>This session we learned:</h3>
<br>

<strong>Basic Print & Output Functions</strong> - things like 'document.write' and 'console.log'

<strong>The difference between Let, Const & Var</strong> - and why we don't tend to use 'var' in modern coding outside of select circumstances (because var is global, and can be reached from outside it's declaration)

<strong>Basic Syntax & case usage</strong> - so things like brackets and camelCase

<strong>Concatenation Operators</strong> (which are a singular + and combine strings together)

<strong>Simple Arithmetic Operators</strong> - so: maths, basically! (but nothing too hard)


Once we'd learned all these we put them together in a task. We had to write a programme that would calculate a bill amount plus a percentage tip - which I'm proud to say I completed independently!
